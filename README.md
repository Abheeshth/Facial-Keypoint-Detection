# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
here I used computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!
I were done this in these 3 Steps 

## Step 1 --> Load and Visualize The data
## Step 2---> Define the Network Architecture
## Step 3 ---> Facial Keypoint detection
